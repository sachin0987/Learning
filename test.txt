Extended Workflow Steps:
Data Retrieval from NMDB:

Develop a script or code that interacts with NMDB's API to fetch device parameters/data.
Access NSO Device Inventory:

Connect to NSO and retrieve the current inventory of devices using the NSO API or relevant commands.
Compare Data from NMDB with NSO Inventory:

Compare the devices retrieved from NMDB with the devices present in the NSO inventory. Identify any discrepancies or missing devices.
Check Device Existence in NSO Inventory:

For each device from NMDB, check if it exists in the NSO inventory. If a device is missing:
Invoke NSO API for Device Addition:

Develop a routine within your code that uses the NSO API to add the missing device to the NSO inventory.
Construct API calls or use NSO Python libraries to send requests to NSO and add the device. Ensure the necessary permissions and authentication are set up.
Check Device Existence in Cisco Crosswork:

After successfully adding the device to NSO, check if the same device exists in Cisco Crosswork.
Add Device to Cisco Crosswork:

If the device is not found in Cisco Crosswork, implement a process to add the device to Crosswork.
Utilize Crosswork's API or relevant commands to add the device to the Crosswork inventory.
Error Handling and Logging:

Implement error handling mechanisms and logging for all operations, including NSO and Crosswork interactions.
Testing and Validation:

Test the entire workflow end-to-end using sample data to ensure devices are correctly identified, added to NSO, and then synchronized with Cisco Crosswork.
Validate the data in Crosswork to confirm the successful addition of devices.
Automation and Scheduling:

Automate the entire workflow and schedule regular runs to maintain consistency between NMDB, NSO, and Crosswork inventories.
